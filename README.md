Introduction
 
 The project was a study experiment to learn how to make a MVC organized project, using JavaScript,CSS and HTML to create a interface which is able to manage a negociation routine.
 
 Architecture
 
 I chose to write and use the array properties to launch the negociation table, such as pushing new data into it and delete negociation rows.
